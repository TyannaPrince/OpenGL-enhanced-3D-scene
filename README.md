Final Project: A 3D Scene
Scene
The overall scene. Requirements were to have at least one complex shape and a light source; I added several of each.
This pen was the first complex shape I built, using a cone and several cylinders. The texture was created by hand in Adobe Illustrator

Coffee
The coffee cup in the scene is made from a combination of shapes, including several hollow cylinders and a flat circle.
Many of the textures are visual tricks. This tablet's buttons are textured to look shadowed, but in fact, this is a flat surface.

Scene Builder and Shape Builder algorithms
All algorithms for constructing shapes in the scene were written by me, from scratch. Each algorithm builds the shape as well as writes the coordinates for the imported textures.

The Final Product: The Scene
There were several requirements for the final project (as can be seen in the documentation above). In this animation, multiple light sources can be seen, including one that is colored. 
The colored light can be turned on and off with the '[' and ']' keys, and the revolving white light can be made stationary with the left or right 'alt' keys. The white light can also be repositioned 
with the letter keys on the right of the keyboard. The camera can be moved using the WASD keys, as well as QE for altitude changes. The speed of the camera can be changed with the mouse wheel, and the
view is changed through mouse movement. Wireframe models are viewable with left and right arrow keys.
